# Chess
My version of chess app. The application has an option to play against a friend or against the phone (AI).
The code uses the mini max algorithm that I wrote which runs possible moves and while scoring the options chooses the best move. I also used Alpha beta sorting which is designed to reduce the running time and make the user experience comfortable and fast.

To create the board, the canvas class is used
